  Enye Interactive is the sole proprietorship owned by Travis Castillo and is based out of Portland, OR.  
  <br/>
  The intention is to develop mobile applications that provide value by building on concepts not covered by other applications.  Ideally in such a way as to remain playful with the medium, as too much seriousness is good for no one.
